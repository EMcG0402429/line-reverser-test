    APPLICATION : LineReverser Project Overview
========================================================================

A little thing thrown together as practice for onea them "programming test" job interviewy bits, because I haven't touched C++ in a while. Actual problem:
(10:19:51 PM) seebs: Well, if you want a nice starter one: C++ program to reverse the order of lines in its input.
(10:20:16 PM) seebs: I am not at all sure what the right solution is, but my first guess would be to try doing it using Vector<string> and hope for the best.

Main.cpp
	Main application source file

LineReverser.cpp
    LineReverser class, which carries out the meat of the operation

Also: A bunch of Visual Studio crap which doesn't appear to be terribly relevent.
